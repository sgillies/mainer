mainer
======

Mainer helps GitHub repo users switch "master" branches to "main".

Branch renaming is the easy part. But you may be left with hundreds or
thousands of links to "master" in GitHub issue and PR comments. This is where
mainer comes in.

Mainer uses the GitHub API to find issues, PRs, and comments which have text
linking to the master branch of a repo (the same or another) and rewrites that
text to link to the main branch instead.

Note well: this is pre-release software. Do use mainer's `--dry-run` mode first
to see what would happen in a real, text-altering use of the program.

# Installation

`python -m pip install --pre mainer`

# Usage

```
$ python -m mainer --help
Usage: mainer.py [OPTIONS] ORG/REPO

  Rewrite links in a repo's issue and PR comments so that they point to the
  linked repo's main branch instead of its master branch.

  Example:

  python -m mainer org1/repo1 --rewrite-links-to org2/repo2 --dry-run

Options:
  --dry-run                Print comment diffs to stderr, but make no edits.
  --rewrite-links-to TEXT  The repo named in the links to be fixed. For
                           example: 'org2/repo2'. Defaults to ORG/REPO.

  --access-token TEXT      A GitHub access token. May also be set by
                           GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN or GithubAccessToken in the
                           environment.

  --help                   Show this message and exit.
```

## Dry run mode

With the `--dry-run` option, mainer prints diffs representing the changes it would make to comments of the target repo.

## Editing mode

**Attention**: without the `--dry-run` option, mainer will edit comments without confirmation prompts or backups (like, for example `sed -i`).
